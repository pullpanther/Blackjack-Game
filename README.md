# Blackjack Game

Welcome to my Blackjack game! This game is built in Javascript and follows the rules of traditional Blackjack.

How to Play

Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
Click the "Draw Card" button to draw a card.
The game will keep track of your score as you draw cards.
If your score goes over 21, you will "go bust" and the game will end.
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust.
